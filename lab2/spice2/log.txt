RF | Mid-Band Gain (av0) | Cutoff Frequency, Upper (fhigh) | Unity-Gain Frequency (ft)

10k | 5.91 dB | 296.98 kHz | 927.17 Hz
20k | 11.91 dB | 158.91 kHz | 412.54 Hz
40k | 17.86 dB | 83.06 kHz | 200.67 Hz

∙ As the RF value is increased...
➤ the mid-band gain increases,
➤ the upper cutoff frequency decreases,
➤ and the unity gain frequency decreases.

The magnitude response plot for each case shows that the response reliably holds it's essential form as a bandpass filter. As the value of the feedback resister is increased, however, the trend of the plots shows that the bandwidth of the bandpass filter decreases while the mid-band gain increases.
