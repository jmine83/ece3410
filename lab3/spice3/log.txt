In the plot produced, it is observed that V_OUT and G_o*V_OFS are identical until the v-sweep reaches 7.083 mV. After this point, V_OUT saturates at 14.194 V while G_o*V_OFS continues along the line of linear voltage increase. This behavior is expected and correlates correctly with the pre-lab analysis.

Frequency, f | Gain (Open-Loop), A

0.5 Hz | 197362 V/V
5.0 Hz | 139560 V/V

It is observed that the open-loop gain at 0.5 Hz and 5 Hz differs by 34.3%. This is reasonably close to the projected 30% difference described in the lab.
